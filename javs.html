    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p><strong>NASA</strong> wants to send astronauts to <strong>Mars.</strong>
         But there need to carry aloong with enough food and oxygen to keep them alive for the period of time they will be staying in Mars.
          <strong>What amount of compressed Oxygen is needed for the Trip if 1 liter of compressed Oxygen can serve a single astronaut for 12 hours</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong><i>NOTE: there are 10 astronauts.</i></strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                The space ship they are going with will not enter Mars with them. And so as a result of that
                and planetary movement. Hence they need to wait for Mars to complete one full revolution so
                as for the position of the spaceship to align with they landing position on Mars before they can
                leave Mars to the spaceship.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The spaceship moves at a speed of 1000Km/hour</li>
            </ol>
                <strong> HINT:</strong><br> Find out the distance from Earth to Mars and how long it takes Mars to complete a
                revolution, then use those parameters to calculate the amount of compressed Oxygen needed
                for trip.
